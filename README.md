# Plan for Comparison
- If you agree, I provide you with the initial distribution for every section.  (Or whatever you prefer, Benjamin)
- 

## MEBT

- [ ] **Objective**: We are considering the *first cavity* in the MEBT line. (GAP vs FIELD)
- [x] **Distribution File**: Please see the file located in `MEBT/distribution`.

---

## DTL

- [ ] **Objective**: We want to check *DTL1*, the first drift tube linac section. (GAP vs. FIELD)
- [ ] **Additional comment**: If possible, when using the *gap model* , analyze also ONLY *the first gap* in DTL1. (Probably not possible to do this with the field-model)
- [ ] **Distribution File**:

## SPK

- [ ] **Objective**: We will check the *first cavity*.
- [ ] **Distribution File**:

---

## High-Beta

- [ ] **Objective**: We are looking at **the first elliptical cavity** in the high-beta section.
