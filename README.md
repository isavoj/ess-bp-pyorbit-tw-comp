# Project Objective
Compare **TraceWin** GAP-models and Field-Map-models with **PyOrbit**.

# Plan for Comparison
- We compare the first elements of these sections: **MEBT, DTL, SPOKE, High-Beta**.
- If you agree, I'll provide the initial distribution for each section. (Or whatever you prefer, Benjamin)
- **0 current** to begin with.
- What exactly do we want to compare?
---

## MEBT

- [ ] **Objective**: We are considering the *first cavity* in the MEBT line. *(GAP vs FIELD)*
- [x] **Distribution File from TW**: Please see the file located in `MEBT/distribution`.

---

## DTL

- [ ] **Objective**: We want to check *DTL1*, the first drift tube linac section. *(GAP vs FIELD)*
- [ ] **Additional Comment**: If possible, when using the *GAP model*, analyze only *the first gap* in DTL1.  
      *(It might not be possible to do this with the field-model.)*
- [ ] **Distribution File from TW**:

## SPK

- [ ] **Objective**: We will check the *first cavity*. *(GAP vs FIELD)*
- [ ] **Distribution File from TW**: 

---

## High-Beta

- [ ] **Objective**: We are looking at **the first elliptical cavity** in the high-beta section. *(GAP vs FIELD)*
- [ ] **Distribution File from TW**:
